# @codex-relay/mobile

## 1.4.0-ship.12

### Patch Changes

- 81c3934: Approve pairing directly in the interactive relay terminal by confirming the code and typing y followed by Enter. Keep the approval command for background relays, and explain both options on the phone.

### Patch Changes

- c5bfb32: Release codex-relay 1.5.0 with Codex SDK and bundled CLI 0.153.4. Warn in the mobile app when the connected relay is older than 1.5.0. Deliver the compatibility warning through the existing OTA release workflow for the current App Store binary.
